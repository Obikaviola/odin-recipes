    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An appetizer that kick. Always a party favorite when we make them. I usually double the recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>12 whole fresh mushroom, tough ends trimmed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Step 1</b>: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray.</li>
        <li><b>Step 2</b>: Clean mushroom with a damp paper towel. Carefully break stems from mushrooms. Finely chop stems and set caps aside.</li>
        <li><b>Step 3</b>: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry chopped mushroom stems and garlic in hot oil until any moisture has disappeared, taking care not to burn the garlic, 3 to 5 minutes. Spread mushrooms mixture into a bowl to cool completely, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Step 4</b>: Stir cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, black pepper, onion powder, and cayenne pepper into the cooled mushroom mixture until very thick and completely mixed. Use a small spoon to fill each mushroom cap with a generous amount of stuffing. Arrange stuffed mushrooms on the prepared cookie sheet.</li>
        <li><b>Step 5</b>: Bake in the preheated oven until piping hot and liquid starts to form under each cap, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
